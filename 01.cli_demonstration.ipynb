    "# IceNet: Basic Command-Line Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The IceNet library provides the ability to download, process, train and predict from end to end. Users can interact with IceNet either via the python interface (see notebook 3: library usage) or via a set of command-line interfaces (CLI) which provide a high-level interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the CLI utilities that are available natively from the library for testing and producing operational forecasts. Via this interface, users can specify data inputs, data processing, training models, using them for predictions and processing outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling approach\n",
    "This modelling approach allows users to immediately utilise the library for producing sea ice concentration forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "The key stages of an end to end run are: \n",

    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to execute the IceNet CLI tools in this notebook you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An internet connection is needed for downloading the source data at the beginning of the notebook,\n",
    "* A suitable place to run this jupyter notebook such as:\n",
    "  * Running `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` on your computer ([see the jupyter project page for more](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html)),\n",
    "  * A jupyterhub instance,\n",
    "  * A development environment such as [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which [can run jupyter notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) (Note: for vscode, you'll need to install `ipykernel` in our conda environment later on), or\n",
    "  * A [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) instance.\n",
    "* A working installation of [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html),\n",
    "* GPUs are required for training (due to size of network, unrealistic to try running on CPU) but not required for predictions.\n",
    "* Knowledge of [Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), [python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) and [shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (links to Carpentries courses on these topics)\n",
    "* There are a few external facilities that we interface with, which you will need to set up if you haven't already.\n",
    "  * Data sources under [Climate and Sea Ice Data](#Climate-and-Sea-Ice-Data) including an account and API token for the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) (detailed later)\n",
    "  * [Wandb](https://wandb.ai/) (Weights and Biases) - which can __optionally__ be used during training for monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll assume that you're running in a local copy of `icenet-notebooks` for this tutorial, and __that one directory up we can deposit other repositories and folders__. If you already have some previous IceNet data available (as we do in `../data`) then you can symlink to it using `ln -s ../data`. The reason for this is described further below, as is the creation of this folder if it doesn't exist.\n",

    "### Installation: Environment Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conda install from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend running IceNet (or any python code) in a virtual environment.\n",
    "Here we will use `conda` to create a virtual environment containing `python` and `icenet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First create a conda environment if you don't have one already:  In a shell (not in this notebook), run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `conda create -n icenet python=3.11`\n",
    "\n",
    "    which creates an environment named `icenet` and installs python 3.11 within it. Follow the prompts at your terminal to complete creation of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alternatively, the [icenet](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet) library has an [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet/environment.yml) file which can be used to create a conda environment with all the necessary packages and their versions installed. To do this, either download the file, or clone the repository and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `conda env create --file environment.yml -n icenet`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activate your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `conda activate icenet`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check that your environment has activated correctly: `which python` should return a path to a python installation corresponding to your new environment (e.g. it should say `icenet` in it somewhere),\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you do not have `netcdf4` installed in your system, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `conda install -c conda-forge netcdf4<1.6.1`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `pip` to install icenet from the Python Package Index (PyPI):\n",
    "\n",
    "    `pip install icenet`\n",
    "\n",
    "    which should install the IceNet package and its dependencies."
   ]
  },

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the icenet library is installed, you'll be able to access all commands made available by the library. Some are utilities that won't be covered, but using `icenet_<TAB>`-complete you should be able to see a list that includes (but ___is not limited to___):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `icenet_data_cmip`\n",
    "* `icenet_data_era5`\n",
    "* `icenet_data_hres`\n",
    "* `icenet_data_masks`\n",
    "* `icenet_data_sic`\n",
    "* `icenet_dataset_create`\n",
    "* `icenet_output`\n",
    "* `icenet_predict`\n",
    "* `icenet_process_cmip`\n",
    "* `icenet_process_era5`\n",
    "* `icenet_process_hres`\n",
    "* `icenet_process_metadata`\n",
    "* `icenet_process_sic`\n",
    "* `icenet_train`\n",
    "* `icenet_plot_forecast`\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these commands are either directly or indirectly (through pipeline shell scripts) used in this notebook...\n",
    "\n",
    "All commands accept options such as `-v` for turning on verbose logging and `-h` for obtaining help about what options they offer. ___As with many shell commands, use `-h` to obtain information about options___.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CLI vs Library vs Pipeline usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The IceNet package is designed to support automated runs from end to end by exposing the above CLI operations. These are simple wrappers around the library itself, and __any__ step of this can be undertaken manually or programmatically by inspecting the relevant endpoints. \n",
    "\n",
    "IceNet can be run in a number of ways: from the command line, the python interface, or as a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb to follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the [pipeline repository](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-pipeline) if you want to run the end to end IceNet processing out of the box.\n",
    "* Adapt or customise this process using `icenet_*` commands described in this notebook and in the scripts contained in the [pipeline repo](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-pipeline).\n",
    "* For ultimate customisation, you can interact with the IceNet repository programmatically (which is how the CLI commands operate.) For more information look at the [IceNet CLI implementations](https://github.com/JimCircadian/icenet2/blob/main/setup.py#L32) and the [library notebook](03.library_usage.ipynb), along with the [library documentation](#TODO).
